# Calculator App in jQuery!
A simple Calculator app in jQuery. I wanted to build this app to get a better understanding of JavaScript and to learn jQuery.

**Link to project:** http://kordellatimer.github.io/jQuery-Calculator

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)

I kept the HTML and CSS  simple. Two input tags for the user to pick two numbers to either add, subtract, divide, or multiply them using the four buttons. I put a click event on every button that will take the value from the input and perform a the action tied to the button. Then after the action is done, output the response in the span tag.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how effective jQuery could be. First with the methods that are tied with jQuery, and how simple the syntax is compared to vanilla JavaScript.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
